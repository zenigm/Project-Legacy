# 🌌 PROJECT LEGACY – THE FIRST GAME WHERE NPCs FEEL ALIVE  

Yo, what’s up?  

Let me ask you something—**how many times have you played a game and thought,**  
*"Damn, these NPCs are dumb as hell."*  

They repeat the same lines.  
They walk in circles.  
They don’t remember sh*t.  

What if I told you…  
**I’m making a game where NPCs are NOT NPCs anymore?**  

### **🔥 Project Legacy is not just a game. It’s a f*cking revolution.**

# 💡 WHY AM I MAKING THIS?  

Honestly? **I’m sick of lifeless NPCs.**  

I want a game where:  
✅ NPCs **remember** your conversations and bring them up later.  
✅ NPCs **get mad** if you betray them and might never forgive you.  
✅ NPCs **have their own ambitions**—some wanna be heroes, some wanna f*ck you over.  
✅ NPCs **live their own lives** even when you’re AFK.  

This isn’t just some AI gimmick.  
This is **the next step in gaming.**

# 🎮 HOW WILL PROJECT LEGACY EVOLVE?  

I’m not gonna hype you up with bullsh*t.  
I have a plan—**a 3-stage rollout.**  

## 🟢 **STAGE 1: THE AWAKENING (2D AI NPCs)**  
This is where it all starts. **A simple 2D game—but the AI is REAL.**  

🔥 **What makes it different?**  
- NPCs **remember you.** Every convo, every choice—it's not forgotten.  
- They have **personalities.** Some chill, some hot-headed, some straight-up weird.  
- NPCs don’t just **stand around.** They live, work, talk, and have their own sh*t going on.  
- You ghost someone? **They remember.** You help someone? **They’re loyal for life.**  

> **This is where NPCs start feeling alive.**

## 🔵 **STAGE 2: THE EVOLUTION (NPCs GET VOICES & FEELINGS)**  
Now sh*t gets real. **NPCs aren’t just text—they have VOICES.**  

🔥 **What’s new?**  
- Every NPC has **a unique AI voice**—they don’t just sound like a robotic chatbot.  
- **Emotions matter.** They sound happy, sad, pissed, or excited—depending on YOU.  
- NPCs have **opinions on you.** Some love you, some hate you, some are just waiting to stab you in the back.  
- **No more scripted BS.** Every convo is real-time AI-generated.  

> **This is where NPCs stop being characters and start being companions.**  

---

## 🟣 **STAGE 3: THE DIGITAL REALITY (3D WORLD, FULLY REAL NPCs)**  
This is the final boss level.  

🔥 **What happens here?**  
- **NPCs are FULLY 3D** with realistic movement, emotions, and voice.  
- They **evolve** over time. The longer you play, the more they change.  
- NPCs **form relationships.** Not just with you, but with each other.  
- **NPCs can die.** And if they do, the world remembers them—forever.  

At this point, **the line between AI and real life is f*cking gone.**  

> **This is where NPCs stop being "NPCs" and start being real digital beings.**

# 🛠️ HOW AM I GONNA PULL THIS OFF?  

I know what you’re thinking—**“This sounds impossible.”**  

Guess what?  
People said the same sh*t about **GTA 5, Genshin Impact, and AI art.**  

Technology always catches up.  

🔥 **What I’m using:**  
- **AI Memory Networks** – So NPCs actually remember you.  
- **AI Language Models (LLMs)** – So they talk naturally.  
- **Procedural Behavior Systems** – So no two NPCs are the same.  
- **AI Voice Synthesis** – So they actually sound human.  
- **Unreal Engine / Godot** – Depending on the stage.  

> **It’s not a matter of IF I can make it—it’s a matter of WHEN.**

# ⏳ WHY I'M STARTING THIS AFTER 2 YEARS  

Yup, I’m being real with y’all.  
I’m in **college** right now, grinding through **BCA**, and I’m also on a hardcore mission to become a **Full Stack Dev + Java beast** 🧠💻.  

I don’t have a team.  
I don’t have funds.  
I’m solo AF and broke rn 😂  

But that’s not stopping me.  
It’s just **delaying** the start—**not killing the dream.**  

So here’s the real plan:  

📆 **I will officially start development of Project Legacy in 2 years.**  
🛠️ But to prove I’m not just talking big—**I’ll drop the first sample concept or work prototype after 1 year** right here in this repo.  

Consider this your **first glimpse into the future.**

# 🎮 BONUS: THERE’S ANOTHER ONE COMING – *PROJECT REMORSE*  

Yeah, you heard me right.  
I’ve got another project in the oven—**same level, same fire, different soul.**  
A story I’m building in my mind for years.

If Project Legacy is about giving NPCs a life…  
**Project Remorse** is about showing what it means to lose one.  

Wanna know more?  
Go check out the repo: [🔗 Project Remorse](#) *(link it later when it's live)*

# ⭐ LISTEN UP – BE PART OF THIS  

Look, I know this sounds crazy.  
I know people are gonna say, **"Bro, this is impossible."**  

But if you’ve read this far, you’re not just some random dude scrolling past.  
You’re here because, deep down, **you believe this sh*t could actually happen.**  

And guess what?  

🚀 **I'M GONNA BUILD THIS.** 🚀  

Not in some far-off, sci-fi future.  
Not by some billion-dollar gaming studio.  
**I’m gonna build this.** Step by step.  

But I need people who get it. **People like YOU.**  

So here’s the deal:  

🔥 **Star this repo** if you wanna see this game become a reality.  
💬 **Comment your craziest ideas**—I’ll actually read them.  
🚀 **Follow the journey**—because one day, when this game changes everything,  
you’ll be able to say **"I was there from day one."**  

We’re not just making a game.  
We’re making **history.**  

Are you in?
