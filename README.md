🕹️ Project Legacy – A Game Where NPCs Truly Live
🚧 In Early Development | 🔥 10-Year Dream Project
💡 Final Name TBD – Placeholder for Now!

📖 Description
Project Legacy is a semi-3D RPG/Sandbox AI-driven game where NPCs don’t just stand around—they live, think, and change based on their experiences.

Unlike traditional games with scripted behavior, my NPCs will:
✔️ Have goals, emotions, and memories that shape their decisions.
✔️ React dynamically to the world and events, not just follow pre-written scripts.
✔️ Form relationships, rivalries, and alliances, making every playthrough unique.

This isn't just a game—it's an attempt to bring NPCs to life.

🛠️ Features & Vision
✅ AI-Driven NPCs – NPCs think, plan, and adapt, like real beings.
✅ Dynamic World – The world reacts to events, not just scripted sequences.
✅ Emergent Storytelling – No linear quests; players shape the world naturally.
✅ Radiant AI & Goal Systems – NPCs will have their own ambitions and behaviors.
✅ Long-Term Development – A passion project that will evolve over the next decade.

🛤️ Roadmap
🔹 Phase 1 (2024-2025) – Core Learning & AI Prototyping
📌 Learn AI programming, game logic, and procedural systems.
📌 Experiment with Godot 4 (GDScript, C#) or Unity (C#).
📌 Build an AI prototype with simple NPC behavior.

🔹 Phase 2 (2026-2028) – Expanding the World & AI Systems
📌 Implement advanced AI decision-making (GOAP, Utility AI).
📌 Create a procedurally generated world with NPC settlements.
📌 Develop memory-based AI where NPCs remember past interactions.

🔹 Phase 3 (2029-2032) – Full Gameplay & Optimization
📌 Fully immersive semi-3D open-world experience.
📌 Optimize AI performance and solve emergent behavior issues.
📌 Beta release & community feedback.

📌 Current Status
🔄 Actively Learning & Building the First Prototype.

Currently researching AI systems and NPC decision-making.
Developing a small sandbox world with AI-driven behaviors.
Testing procedural storytelling mechanics.
📸 Progress & Devlogs
🔜 Screenshots, GIFs, and gameplay clips will be added here soon!

💬 Stay Updated / Contribute
This is a solo project, but in the future, I may open contributions for:
📌 AI logic & NPC behavior scripts.
📌 UI/UX design and world-building ideas.
