# 🕹️ Project Legacy - A Game Where NPCs Truly Live  

🚧 *This game is in early development and will evolve over the next 10 years.*  
💡 *Final name TBD – this is just a placeholder!*  

---

## 📖 Description  
**Project Legacy** is an RPG/Sandbox AI-driven game where NPCs don’t just stand around—they live, think, and change based on their experiences. Unlike traditional games, NPCs will have goals, emotions, and memories that shape their decisions, making every playthrough feel like a living, breathing world.

✔️ **Dynamic World** – A world that reacts to events, not just scripted sequences.  
✔️ **Emergent Storytelling** – No linear quests; every player’s journey is unique.  
✔️ **Radiant AI & Goal Systems** – NPCs with needs, ambitions, and rivalries.  
✔️ **Long-Term Development** – This is a personal dream project that I plan to build over a decade.
