# Project-Legacy
Project Legacy is an RPG/Sandbox AI-driven game where NPCs don’t just stand around—they live, think, and change based on their experiences. Unlike traditional games, NPCs will have goals, emotions, and memories that shape their decisions, making every playthrough feel like a living, breathing world.
